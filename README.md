# HandWritten-Digit-Recognition
MNIST Dataset is used by the model and can be downloaded from the link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
Added autoencoder.py file that denoises the input image using an encoder-decoder Convolution network. A Streamlit web Application also created that can be used for visualization of the input noisy image and the output denoised image.Some sample outputs of the trained model and of the streamlit web application are also added.
